There are a number of example files in the `MathJax3 demo repository
<https://github.com/mathjax/mj3-demos>`__ (see the `list of demos
<https://github.com/mathjax/mj3-demos#samples-of-mathjax-v3>`__).
These include documentation as well as live examples that you can
run.

Needed examples:

* configure using an external script
* have external script load mathjax itself
* load mathjax only if there is math on the page
* synchronize with promises
* reset equation numbering

* v2 compatibility (including \require renaming through MathJax.startup.path or source)

* MathML for AssistiveMML replacement
* MathML for NativeMML replacement
